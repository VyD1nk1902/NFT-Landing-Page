# React + TypeScript + Vite

NFT Landing Page
Figma Cut Practice

## Features

I'm still learning React, Tailwind Css , Typescript so this is one of my landing page for practicing.
In this page I divide section into small component and put it in layout folder (should be modules instead of layout -.-)
I use Zustand for state management and this npm-package for animation cards: 👉 [React Fast Marquee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fast-marquee)
